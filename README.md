Person Re-identification is the task of matching images of a person across multiple camera views

1.[A very nice tutorial for generative vs discriminative modelling](https://youtu.be/OWJ8xVGRyFA).

2.[Some Papers on deep learning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-aXevK_YlhQo0qhQxabrOqgD4LHse7dsClfdWR2g5VU/edit#gid=0).

3.A couple of blogs on RNN:
[R2R](http://r2rt.com/written-memories-understanding-deriving-and-extending-the-lstm.html#fn3) and [WildML](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/). These blogs have explanation of each and everything related to RNN in a very nice manner.
